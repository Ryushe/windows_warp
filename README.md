# Windows Warp

The replacement for Alt+Tab that you've been looking for. Switch to apps immediately, push apps away and pull them back. But best of all, be in control of your workflow. 

## Setup

1. Install AutoHotkey v2.
2. Clone or download this folder to your machine.
3. Run `Windows Warp.ahk`.
4. Optional: add `Windows Warp.ahk` to Startup if you want it to launch with Windows.
5. Use `Win+B` to open the editor and adjust app hotkeys or workspace openers.

## Features

- Push the focused window left or right across monitors while preserving relative placement.
- Pull the most recently pushed window back to the main monitor.
- Create app-specific hotkeys from a popup editor.
- Use tap vs hold behavior on app hotkeys, including mouse-aware tiling on the main monitor.
- Save and relaunch workspace opener profiles for commonly used app layouts.
- Browse existing hotkeys from a dedicated hotkey browser.
- Reassign shared hotkeys and create custom app hotkeys without hand-editing the script.
- Toggle all Windows Warp hotkeys on or off.
- Support main-monitor and burner-monitor app behaviors.

## Default Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Action |

## Notes

- Scripts are written for AutoHotkey v2.
- `Windows Warp.ahk` is the single entry point and tray icon.
- App hotkeys are stored in `window_manager_apps.ini`.
- Shared hotkeys are stored in `hotkey_registry.ini`.
- Workspace opener profiles are stored locally in `workspace_openers.ini`.

## Future Ideas

- Add a hold-mode selector in Settings so hold behavior can switch between the current mouse-aware tiling flow and a radial app picker for multi-instance apps.
- Explore a consistent dock/radial layout so app positions stay stable between opens, with room for paging or grouped slots when an app has multiple instances.
